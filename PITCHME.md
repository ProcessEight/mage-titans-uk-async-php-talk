## What it is (Asynchronous), What it isn't (multi-threaded)
* Disadvantages of threads (See Learning Event-Driven PHP ebook p14)

---

## Why not use NodeJS or Go?
* You would have to re-tool your whole stack and deployment framework for the new languages
* Learn a whole new language and language ecosystem

---

## PHP: The synchronous model

---

## PHP: The asynchronous model

---

## Include slide on async jargon:

* Demo of different async concepts

---

# Coroutines

---

## Promises

---

## Events

---

## 'calculations are fast, input/output is slow.'

---

## How to solve common problems in Magento using async techniques:

---

## Bulk operations, e.g. Image processing

---

## Indexing

---

## Bulk saves/deletes

---

## Data import/export?

---

## The integration (the 2 million prices):

---

* Explain business case: The different price-affecting criteria, any other relevant details

---

* Explain the basic architecture of the solution

---

* Briefly cover which tools, libraries, frameworks were used. Keep it vague/brief. It is not important to go into detail.

---

* Side by side demos (not live) of sync solution and async solution, demonstrating how long it takes to import an API response.

---

* Link to demo implementation or smaller demos which demo each concept (proof of concept apps) in GitHub
